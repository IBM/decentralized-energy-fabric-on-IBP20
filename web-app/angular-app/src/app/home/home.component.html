        <p class=""> This Blockchain application demonstrates energy sharing on a network among 'Residents' on a grid. The energy trade is based on exchanging coins for energy provided. The network also includes 'Utility Companies' to trade excess energy with or obtain energy from, and 'Banks' to exchange cash (fiat money) for coins.  </p>
